Some work made to replay scenes from the game

In 2010, I did some work to replay the graphics from the CD game. As a kid, this was my introduction to multimedia and games on CD. It really was ahead of its time.

So I sat down one weekend and did some work to play the scenes. It wasn't difficult, no compression was even applied, so no reverse engineering took play. Just trial-and-error.

I published the screenshots on flickr (they're no longer there), and I was contacted by Laura Buddine who was the Executive Producer and made the game. She said they were working on a remastering of this game. This was still in 2010. I met Laura at her home and we talked game development. She was such a nice person. 

A bit later she asked me to help with recovering audio, they lost some of the tapes, and the game that had the best quality was the FM Towns, I wrote a small script and it's in this repo.

The remaster project was never complete. I was lucky to saw the beta and it looked surprisingly good. 

I recently started going through hard drive backups. I have backups going all the way back to 1995. That's how I found these scripts, and is a reminder for me to add support to ScummVM at some point, make this game playable by many.

Laura passed away in 2018. She was loved by many: https://www.facebook.com/laura.buddine
